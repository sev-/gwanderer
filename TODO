TODO list:

* Create gwanderer.sourceforge.net site

* Convert help files to HTML

* Remove all references to gnobots

* Put all code in order to look more Gnomish not in a way of year 1988 :)

* Add hi-scores tracking

* Make death reporting look better

* Make initial screen instead of zillion ??'s

* Add intl hooks to old code, so it would be possible to translate the game

* Take a look into wander-1.0 and xwangerer code to see any other new game
  features (I feel that wander had those)

* Add possibility to switch themes. Particalrly this requires redesign
  of display routines to show arbitrary size pixmaps with scrolling

* Add animations

* Implement screens editor
